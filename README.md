# Simple Banking System

## Description
In this project, we explore how banking systems function and leverage Python for programming logic and SQL for database management.
This project is part of the Databases with SQL and Python course on the [Hyperskill platform](https://hyperskill.org).

## Project Structure
The project is organized into four stages:
- **Stage 1**: Card Anatomy
- **Stage 2**: Luhn Algorithm
- **Stage 3**: Creating Database
- **Stage 4**: Advanced System

### Overview
- **Stage 1**: In this stage, the program allows customers to:
  1. Create an Account: Generate a unique card number and PIN, storing this information temporarily.
  2. Log into an Account: Verify users by asking for their card number and PIN, then granting access to view their balance.
  3. Exit: Users can log out or exit the program.
- **Stage 2**: Implement the Luhn Algorithm to check the validity of the generated card number.
  1. Change the credit card generation algorithm so that card numbers pass the Luhn algorithm.
